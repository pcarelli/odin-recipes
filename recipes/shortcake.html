    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Strawberry shortcake is a light, summertime dessert that is usually comprised of strawberries, shortcake and fresh whipped cream. It's best enjoyed outdoors after a dip in the lake, or after a fresh grilled cheeseburger or hot dog.</p>
    <p>Strawberry shortcake is the king of all shortcakes. You never hear about blueberry, raspberry or pineapple shortcakes, because they don't stand a chance against the superior strawberry. They also don't have the added benefit of alliteration, unless you're making a Star Fruit Shortcake, but where does one even acquire a Star Fruit??</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pints of fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of white sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of shortening</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of milk</li>
        <li> 2 cups of whipped heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the strawberries, toss them with 1/2 cup of white sugar and set aside</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Grease and flour one 8-inch round cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl combine the flour, baking powder, 2 tablespoons white sugar and the salt. With a pastry blender, cut in the shortening until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center and add the beaten egg and milk.</li>
        <li> Stire the mixture until just combined</li>
        <li>Spread the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake at 425 degrees F for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool partially in the pan or on a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Slice partially cooled cake in half, making two layers.</li>
        <li>Place half of the strawberries on one layer and top with the other layer. Top with remaining strawberries and cover with the whipped cream.</li>
    </ol>
